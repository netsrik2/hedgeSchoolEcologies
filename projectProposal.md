Hedge School Ecologies Project
Artist/Researcher Niamh McDonnell in partnership with Columba College
Sept 2023 - May 2024
Liaison with teachers scheduled at their convenience, conversation 20-30mins
1.1. Summary of your proposal
Please summarise in no more than three short bullet points what you want to do and
why (max. 300 characters including spaces/approx. 50 words).
Research the idea of a virtual Ecological Hedge School. Creative activities and
community engagements will inform the development of art based learning resources.
Mentoring from an artist will contribute to the creation of a trans-disciplinary
pedagogical framework for young people and teachers.
1.2. Details of your proposal
Please describe your proposal in more detail (max. 3,000 characters including
spaces/approx. 500 words).
What you write here is a key part of your proposal, and should help those involved in
assessing your application to understand the full scope of what you want to do and
why. It might include details such as a practical explanation of the activity you
propose, your artistic goals and ambitions, the wider context in which you are
making the proposal, and any other information you consider relevant.
My proposal explores the construction of a virtual space for TY and SN pupils to
learn about ecology through art activities. It comes out of research on the archive of a
Hedge School teaching manuscript compiled by a Cavan Hedge School Master from
the 1800s, as well as an artifact of a folk custom representing a Meath-based
community interaction with a hedgerow in their rural environment.
This provides me with two scripts for re-constructing sets of resources for learning
about ecology through hands on art activities. The Hedge School master archive
teaches maths, geometry, account keeping, astronomy, writing legal documents as
well as love letters. This presents the basis for Hedge School Ecologies instruction
through History, Geography, Home Economics, Biology, Irish, Agri Science,
Woodwork Construction and Art. The history of the Hedge School is about inclusion
of the marginal, a temporary teaching platform for the Gaelic Irish excluded from
formal education. However, this archive represents a model of top-down formal
education insofar as subjects were taught through English, the universal language of
suffrage under Enlightenment idealism.
The artifact of folk custom, provides a bottom-up model of learning through hands-on
engagement. The topiary shape cut into a hedge standing at a rural crossroads is
festooned by locals with real and artificial flowers, marking the passing of a
community member and also acting as a form of inscribing wishes for the future. The
cultivation of this topiary shape by the community was likely prompted by the
projection of the imagination, associating the shape with a vaguely bunny like form.
This introduces the script with directions for thinking about the space of transition in
TY pedagogy, understood in terms of prompting the imagination and its capacity for
image projection by means of art making, interacting with nature. Another way of
reading the Hedge School master archive that compliments this approach, focuses on
the sketches and doodles that are found in the margins of the text. By looking at the
manuscript page as a fluid space of mark making, the hand written inscription and the
image flow into one another. This provides a script with possible instructions for an
art activity, creating a space for learning through play engaging SN pupils with
literacy difficulties.
The Greek root of ecology, oikos, meaning host, is articulated in the dramatization of
the scripts, staging scenes for learning through narratives connecting ideas. The
Hedge School becomes a stage set for interacting with the bogland, as a marginal
territory. Conversation with the HE teacher will consider the possibility of food
fermenting workshops for learning about the process of culturing an environment,
creating a host for population by microbes. The microbial activity of feeding on
sugars creates the acidic conditions that preserves the food. This contextualizes
further conversations with History, Geography, Biology, Irish, Agri Science,
Woodwork Construction and Art teachers about introducing the role of microbes in
the geological process of peat formation, the ecological value of the land undergoing
fermentation in terms of how controlled irrigation enables it to perform as a carbon
sink.
